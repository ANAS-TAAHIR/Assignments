## Python Practice
This Python practice is for beginners. It also includes practices for NumPy and all important concepts of it.  

### 1. Information Retrival System (IRS)
In this Assignment/Project assigned by my professor, I have to create a basic type of Search Engine using the vector form of search input. I used NumPy because of it's power and speed. This project has two versions i.e Simple Searching Algorithm, Synonym based Searching Algorithm

### 2. Linear Regression (Simultaneous Equations)
In this Assignment/Project , I have to code the Linear Regression Model using NumPy. This the implementation of Linear Regression with Simultaneous Equation. It contains Linear, Quadratic, Cubic and upto 6 degree models. I have also measured the accuracy tests and compared each model accuracy.

### 3. Linear Regression (Gradient Descent)
In this Assignment/Project , I have coded Linear Regression Model using Gradient Descent Algorithm. I also wrote Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) using Gradient Descent.
